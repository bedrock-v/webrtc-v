// Package rtp implements the RTP packet format (RFC 3550) and the header
// extension mechanism WebRTC relies on (RFC 8285).
//
// The package is deliberately about packets, not about sessions: it has no
// timers, no jitter buffer and no notion of a stream. Higher layers compose
// those on top. That split keeps the parser - the part that touches bytes from
// the network - small enough to reason about completely.
