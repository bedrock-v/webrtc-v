// Package logging provides the leveled logger used throughout the WebRTC
// stack.
//
// The library never writes to stdout and never picks a logging framework for
// the application. It emits records through the Sink interface; the default
// sink writes human-readable lines to stderr and is quiet below the warn level,
// so a library user who configures nothing sees only what they need to act on.
